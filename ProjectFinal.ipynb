For the sex attribute figure, 0 means male and 1 means female. In addition, we could see that for each figure,  it has a black bar which indicates the quartile range used to read the data distribution more clearly and tell us which parts of data are the outlier.

    "In this article, we mainly focus on doing analysis on the relationship among age, resting blood pressure, maximum heart rate and the ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest. The reason we mainly focus on analyzing these attribute is since their correlation value is higher than other groups.\n",
    "According to our current analysis, we think that people who have are under 50 years old with high resting blood pressure may increase the opportunity to have cardiovascular events. In addition, people who are under 50 years old with high serum cholesterol level especially people who have exercise-induced angina, it has higher possibility to have cardiovascular events than others. Finally, we people who have a higher level of ST depression will have relatively high possible to have cardiovascular events than others.\n",
    "Therefore, young people especially who have a high level of resting blood pressure,  serum cholesterol and ST depression should be more careful to supervise themselves in case of having cardiovascular events.\n"
